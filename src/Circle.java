There is a class named Circle. This class has one field radiusof the double type.

Create two instance methods for this class:

getLength that returns the double representing the length of the circumference of this circle;
getArea that returns the double representing the area of this circle.
In your calculations, you may use the special constant Math.PI.

Do not make the field and methods private.
